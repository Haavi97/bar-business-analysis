## üöÄ Getting Started

### Live Demo
Check out the live demo of the dashboard at [bar-business-analysis.streamlit.app](https://bar-business-analysis.streamlit.app)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 (recommended)
- Virtual environment manager

We strongly recommend using Python 3.11 for optimal performance and compatibility. While the application may work with other Python versions, it has been thoroughly tested with Python 3.11.

### Setting up the Development Environment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Haavi97/bar-business-analysis.git
cd bar-business-analysis
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy==1.24.3
pip install pandas==2.0.3
pip install streamlit==1.29.0
pip install bokeh==3.3.0
```

3. Run the dashboard:
```bash

```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Setting Up Initial Parameters
1. Use the sidebar to input basic business parameters:
   - Location selection
   - Premises size
   - Operating hours
   - Staffing levels

### Understanding the Metrics
- **Pour Cost**: Cost of ingredients as a percentage of drink price
  - Industry standard: 18-24%
  - Lower percentages indicate better margins

- **Customer Volume**: Expected customers per hour
  - Affects staffing requirements
  - Influences utility costs
  - Drives revenue projections

### Interpreting Results
- **Break-even Analysis**: Shows when initial investment will be recovered
- **Profit Projections**: Monthly and annual profit expectations
- **Cost Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of fixed and variable costs

## üîÑ Business Model Assumptions

### Seasonal Variations
- Summer months: +20-30% revenue
- Winter holidays: +40% revenue
- January-February: -20% revenue
- Spring/Fall: Baseline

### Growth Patterns
- Months 1-3: Initial slow growth
- Months 4-8: Accelerated growth
- Months 9+: Stabilization

### Cost Scaling
- Fixed costs: 60% of base costs
- Staff costs: Step function based on customer volume
- Variable costs: Non-linear scaling with revenue
- Maintenance: Time-dependent increase

## üìù Notes
- All financial calculations are in Euros (‚Ç¨)
- Tax calculations based on Estonian regulations
- Labor costs include social tax (33%) and unemployment insurance (0.8%)
- Utility costs include seasonal variations for heating/cooling
